# ðŸ“– About

**RocketShoes** is a web application, created to be a simple example of an e-commerce.

This project is part of a series of mandatory challenges to be completed onÂ [Rocketseat's](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/)Â Ignite course, React trail.

The application developed in the course does not use MirageJS, but JSON Server, however, as I would like to host the application on Vercel, so that everyone could see the application in operation, I carried out this migration, the application continues to work the same the way it was originally developed during the course.
